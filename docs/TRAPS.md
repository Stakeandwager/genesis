# Traps

Things that have cost real time on this project, written down so they cost it
once. Each entry is the **signature** you will actually see, then the cause,
then what to do. Added to whenever something bites.

These are not Genesis defects. They are defects in how the work gets done —
which have been more expensive than the defects in the code.

---

## 1. A shallow clone gets the wrong month's code

**Signature:** the code you are reading does not match what the owner
describes, and nothing in it is obviously broken. Files you were told about
are missing.

**Cause:** `git clone --depth 1` fetches the default branch only. On this
repository that is `main`, which is a month behind. The work lives on
`prototype-002a`.

**Do:** clone with the branch named, or fetch it explicitly.

```
git clone -b prototype-002a https://github.com/Stakeandwager/genesis
```

An hour went into reasoning about Prototype 001 as though it were current.

## 2. A stale working copy, confidently described

**Signature:** commands are handed over for work that is already committed and
pushed. `git commit` reports **1 file changed** where eleven were expected.

**Cause:** an assistant's mirror of the repository was behind the owner's, and
the state of the repository was asserted from memory rather than read.

What actually happened on 2026-10-10: 004 and the removal of the dead
interpreter were already on the remote as `387325c` and `f0d641a`. Commands
for 004 were issued anyway, so `git add scripts` picked up **005** and
committed it under 004's message. Nothing was lost — the message was amended
before pushing — but the whole sequence was avoidable.

**Do:** read `git log --oneline -6` and `git status` **before** writing a
commit message, never after.

This is the same failure as the `around` bug in `003-container-fitting.md`:
the thing that acts and the thing that describes read from different sources.
There the fix was `WorldRegistry.around_of()`. Here the fix is the same rule
applied to a person: do not describe a state you have not just read.

## 3. A blocked push, retried instead of reported

**Signature:** a long gap with little to show for it. `git push` returns

```
remote: access denied by the git proxy: ... is not in this session's
authorized repository set
fatal: ... The requested URL returned error: 403
```

**Cause:** an assistant session is not always authorised to write to the
owner's GitHub. The failure is a permission boundary, not a transient error,
so retrying cannot succeed. A stop-hook that checks for unpushed commits will
keep prompting, and the loop is: commit locally → push → 403 → clean up →
commit locally again.

**Do:** on the first 403, stop. Say the push cannot happen from here, and hand
over a patch instead of files:

```
git format-patch -1 HEAD --stdout > NAME.patch
```

The owner applies it with one command, and the authorship and message survive
intact:

```
git am "C:\Users\Owner\Downloads\NAME.patch"
```

`git am --abort` puts everything back if it will not apply.

**Also do:** leave no local commit behind in a mirror that cannot push. A
commit sitting in an unpushable copy is the cause of trap 2 next time.

---

## 4. `findstr` treats spaces as OR

**Signature:** a search for an exact phrase returns most of the file.

**Cause:** `findstr /n "POND_HEIGHT :="` searches for `POND_HEIGHT` **or**
`:=`.

**Do:** use `/c:` for a literal string.

```
findstr /n /c:"POND_HEIGHT :=" scripts\farm_module.gd
```

---

## 5. Expected output shown as something to paste

**Signature:** the owner pastes two readbacks into the input box as one line,
or pastes an expected result back into the game.

**Cause:** an assistant put *what you should see* in a code block. In this
conversation a code block has meant *type this*, every time, for weeks.

**Do:** inputs in code blocks, one per block, one at a time. Expected output
in prose.

---

## 6. A green suite that tests nothing

**Signature:** every test passes, including a new one, and the feature it
covers has never once failed.

**Cause:** the check cannot be reached by any legal input. 005's physical
reachability check passed 147 of 147 dungeons and could not have failed any of
them: the tightest room the schema allows leaves a body 0.8 m of slack.

**Do:** for each new check, ask whether a legal input could ever make it fail,
and write the test that answers it. `docs/harness/sweep_test.gd.txt` is the
pattern. A check that cannot fail is a guard against future change — worth
keeping, worth labelling, not worth counting as a measurement.

> A successful build is not evidence of successful understanding.
> A passing test is not evidence that anything was tested.
